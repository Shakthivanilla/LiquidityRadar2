2. Liquidity Projection (Time-Series Forecasting)
For forecasting, we'll use a simple but powerful ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) model from the statsmodels library. This model analyzes past data to project future trends. Like before, we'll simulate historical data for a selected member to train the model.

How to Implement:

Replace the "LIQUIDITY FORECAST SIMULATION" section of your code with this block.

Python

# ===============================
#  ðŸ”® LIQUIDITY FORECAST SIMULATION (Using statsmodels ARIMA)
# ===============================
st.markdown("---")
st.subheader("ðŸ”® Liquidity Projection (Next 3 Months)")

from statsmodels.tsa.arima.model import ARIMA
import warnings
warnings.filterwarnings("ignore") # Suppress ARIMA warnings

member = st.selectbox('Select Member', df['NAME'])
selected = df[df['NAME'] == member].iloc[0]

# --- Step 1: Simulate Historical Data for the Selected Member ---
# In a real-world scenario, you would query this member's past 12-24 months of data.
# We create 12 months of historical data with a slight upward trend.
np.random.seed(42)
historical_months = 12
base_cash = selected['CASH_BUFFER_USD']
base_credit = selected['CREDIT_HEADROOM_USD']

# Generate a series with some trend and noise
cash_history = pd.Series([base_cash * (1 + 0.01 * i + np.random.normal(0, 0.05)) for i in range(-historical_months, 0)])
credit_history = pd.Series([base_credit * (1 + 0.008 * i + np.random.normal(0, 0.04)) for i in range(-historical_months, 0)])

# --- Step 2: Train ARIMA models and Forecast ---
# We create one forecast for cash and one for credit.
# The order (p,d,q) is a simple starting point; it can be tuned for better accuracy.
# Cash Forecast
cash_model = ARIMA(cash_history, order=(2, 1, 1)).fit()
cash_forecast_values = cash_model.forecast(steps=3)

# Credit Forecast
credit_model = ARIMA(credit_history, order=(2, 1, 1)).fit()
credit_forecast_values = credit_model.forecast(steps=3)

# --- Step 3: Combine Current and Forecasted Data for Plotting ---
months = ['Current', 'Month 1', 'Month 2', 'Month 3']
cash_forecast = [base_cash] + list(cash_forecast_values)
credit_forecast = [base_credit] + list(credit_forecast_values)

# --- Step 4: Display the Chart ---
fig, ax = plt.subplots()
ax.plot(months, cash_forecast, marker='o', label='Cash Buffer Forecast')
ax.plot(months, credit_forecast, marker='o', label='Credit Headroom Forecast')
ax.set_ylabel('USD')
ax.set_title(f'Projected Liquidity for {member}')
ax.legend()
ax.grid(True, linestyle='--', alpha=0.6)
st.pyplot(fig)
By integrating these genuine machine learning models, you significantly elevate the technical depth and credibility of your project, demonstrating a clear path from a proof-of-concept to a robust, data-driven tool.
